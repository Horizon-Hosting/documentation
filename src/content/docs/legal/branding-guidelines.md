Please remember that you are responsible for using the correct and most up to date brand assets. Thank you for respecting our assets and terms

## To Do and What Not To Do
Here is a simple and short list of what you should and shouldn't do with our assets. The guidelines will be imitated using the main logo, however these guidelines apply to all Horzion assets.

## What you can do
#### Use Different Backgrounds
<img src="https://archive.hrznhosting.com/Resources/Brand_Guidelines/background_do_x2.png" class="mw-100 p-2" style="background: whitesmoke; border-radius: 2px;"/>
You may use photographs or colours for a background of a logo provided you have the legal rights to use them. You should also ensure that there is sufficient contrast between the background and logo to keep the logo recognizable and legible.

#### Use the Icon Without the Wordmark
<img src="https://archive.hrznhosting.com/Resources/Brand_Guidelines/onlyicon_do_x2.png" class="mw-100 p-2" style="background: whitesmoke; border-radius: 2px;"/>
You may remove the wordmark from the logo to shorten its length or allow it to be used in smaller areas.

#### Change to be Black & White
<img src="https://archive.hrznhosting.com/Resources/Brand_Guidelines/bw_do_x2.png" class="mw-100 p-2" style="background: whitesmoke; border-radius: 2px;"/>
If you wish to make the icon black and white ensure that the contrast between the background and logo is at a sufficient level that the logo is still legible and recognizable.

#### Ensure the Exclusion Zone is Clear
<img src="https://archive.hrznhosting.com/Resources/Brand_Guidelines/exclusion_do_x2.png" class="mw-100 p-2" style="background: whitesmoke; border-radius: 2px;"/>
You should ensure that the exclusion zone is not being intruded upon by other objects.

#### Stay Within The Minimum Constraints
<img src="https://archive.hrznhosting.com/Resources/Brand_Guidelines/constraints_do_x2.png" class="mw-100 p-2" style="background: whitesmoke; border-radius: 2px;"/>
You should make sure that the logo is above 50px / 5cm in height and is recognizable and legible.

## Use Colours Chosen by Us
You should ensure that any background colour is chosen from our own brand colours.</p>

## Always Attribute
When using any Horizon assets, you should always give attributions towards ourselves and a link to <a href="https://hrznhosting.com">hrznhosting.com</a>.

## Use Correct Grammar and Punctuation
You should always spell and capitalise all names as they are displayed as on our service list. For example always give our services a captial letter at the start of their name.

## What you shouldn't do

<img src="https://archive.hrznhosting.com/Resources/Brand_Guidelines/change_dont_x2.png" class="mw-100 p-2" style="background: whitesmoke; border-radius: 2px;"/>

<img src="https://archive.hrznhosting.com/Resources/Brand_Guidelines/wordmark_dont_x2.png" class="mw-100 p-2" style="background: whitesmoke; border-radius: 2px;"/>
You should always show the wordmark with the icon or the icon alone, never use the wordmark by itself.

## Special Badges
Current Horizon doesn't provide any special badges for partnerships, etc. In the future if Horizon supports these special badges, a section will be added to include them.

## Brand Colours
These are the redefined colours for Horizon Hosting. We do not own the rights to any colour palettes shown, most have been selected from <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors">tailwindcss</a>.

## Colour Palette Suggestions
Whilst you must use the colour palettes shown when creating or modifying any Horizon Assets you are not required, but are suggested to follow our suggestions for how the colours are used.

When using the Slate palette use it as a gray or black, please use its lighter colours for text whilst its lowers as background and contrast elements.

When using Horizon Red ensure that it used in proportion. You may use Horizon Red to highlight or outline features of the Horizon brand. Ensure that when using Horizon Red you also use a lower white to ensure contrast between major keywords or text and the other words.

When using other colours ensure that they have correct contrast, try to be conservative when using colours or light within it to ensure it is not overpowering.

You may use images alongside text if there is void space which should be filled. When using images ensure there is enough space to keep the text legible whilst ensuring that it does not create an unnecessary void.
